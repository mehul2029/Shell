Contribution from team members:

1. Aditya Divekar: Implemented history feature, and bang commands, Makefile.
                   Implemented builtin function "cd".
                   (history.c, builtin.c, Makefile)

2. Mehul Jain: Implemented complete structure of Shell. Implemented
               excecution of non-piped commands. Written documentation.
               (cmd.c, linkedlist.c, main.c)

3. Abheek Ghosh: Implemented piped commands excecution. (cmd.c)

4. Divye Vats: Helped with implementation of shell.



Basic Structure of AADM shell:

1. Internally shell stores all the user input in a linked list by setting
   delimiters as ' ' and '|'.



Implementation:

1. Shell uses execvp() system call to execute commands in a child process.

2. In case of pipe, a recursive approch has been choosen. 1st commands
   is executed followed by next command and so via calling the same
   function recursively.

3. History feature is implemented by storing data in a file.



Few Extra features:

1. Ctrl + c stops the ongoing process and make way for shell to take
   input again.

2. "exit" kills the shell.

3. Piping can be done any number of times.



Limitations and Bugs:

1. Ctrl+z doesn't work.

2. Commands like "git commit -m 'some thing'" won't work because
   the parser in the shell will create tokens as
   
   			<git> <commit> <-m> <'some> <thing'>

   whereas the correct sequence should be
   			<git> <commit> <-m> <'some thing'>

   This happens because delimiter is ' ' (space) and parser doesn't
   ignore spaces after `'` character until it again sees it.

3. !(some character) does not work. Eg. !g should run the last command
   which starts with "g".

4. The custom implementations of the "history" and the bang commands
   do not work in pipeline.

5. Auto-complete feature is not there.

6. Arrow keys doesn't works.
