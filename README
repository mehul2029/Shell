Contribution from team members:

1. Aditya Divekar: Implemented History feature. (History.c)

2. Mehul Jain: Implemented complete structure of Shell. Implemented
			   excecution of non-piped commands. Written documentation.
			   (cmd.c, linkedlist.c)

3. Abheek Ghosh: Implemented piped commands excecution. (cmd.c, makefile)

4. Divye Vats: Helped with implementation of shell. (main.c)



Basic Structure of AADM shell:

1. Internally shell stores all the user input in a linked list by setting
   delimiters as ' ' and '|'.



Implementation:

1. Shell uses execvp() system call to exceute commands in a child process.

2. In case of pipe, a recursive approch has been choosen. 1st commands
   is executed followed by next command and so via calling the same
   function recursively.

3. History feature is implemented by storing data in a file.



Few Extra features:

1. Ctrl + c stops the ongoing process and make way for shell to take
   input again.

2. "exit" kills the shell.

3. Piping can be done any number of times.



Limitations and Bugs:

1. Few commands don't work, such as "cd".
2. Ctrl+z doesn't work.
3. commands like "git commit -m 'some thing'" won't work because
   the parser in the shell will create tokens as
   
   			<git> <commit> <-m> <'some> <thing'>

   whereas the correct sequence should be
   			<git> <commit> <-m> <'some thing'>

   This happens because delimiter is ' ' (space) and parser doesn't
   ignore spaces after `'` character until it again sees it.

4. !(some character) does not work. Eg. !g should run the last commad
   which starts with "g".
